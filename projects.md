# My Projects

## Project 1 – Mandelbrot Project
Group project on the Mandel 
Goal was to create an image 
Where using the formula zn+1​=zn2​+c we see if the number zn goes toward infinity
If it does the color would change depending on how many iterations it takes to go towards infinity
If it doesn't go towards infinity by a certain number, we would put a color to signify this

## Project 2 – Roblox Game
Made a roblox game with my freind 
Developed the programming side of the game
Made a spleef game where people use guns to shoot the ground to make it disappear
